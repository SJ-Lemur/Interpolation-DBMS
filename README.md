The Polynomial Interpolation Data Management System is a Tkinter application designed 
to store, retrieve, and analyze datasets using polynomial interpolation techniques. The 
system allows users to input data points, perform polynomial interpolation to estimate 
values between data points, visualize the interpolated polynomial, and store the datasets 
in a relational database.
